# VehicleService Module Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a complete CRUD module for VehicleService following the established project patterns using Actions, Services, Livewire components, Flux UI, and Tailwind CSS.

## Current Analysis
- **Model**: `app/Models/VehicleService.php` exists with basic structure (name, status fields)
- **Pattern**: Following Admin module structure with Action-Service-Livewire pattern
- **Technology**: Laravel + Livewire + Flux UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Reusable Components**: Table, form, button, and container components available

## Implementation Tasks - ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Model Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Enhanced VehicleService model with proper configuration
- ✅ Added scopes, mutators, and helper methods following Admin pattern
- ✅ Added proper fillable fields, hidden fields, and casts

### 2. Service Layer ✅
- ✅ Created `VehicleServiceService` extending base `Service` class
- ✅ Configured searchable fields and pagination
- ✅ Implemented domain-specific methods (getActiveServices, searchByName, getStatistics)

### 3. Action Layer ✅
- ✅ Created `CreateVehicleServiceAction` with validation and business logic
- ✅ Created `UpdateVehicleServiceAction` with proper update handling
- ✅ Followed transaction patterns and error handling from base Action class

### 4. Livewire Components ✅
- ✅ Created `GetVehicleServicesComponent` for listing with pagination, search, and filters
- ✅ Created `CreateVehicleServiceComponent` for creating new records
- ✅ Created `UpdateVehicleServiceComponent` for editing existing records
- ✅ Used `HandlesActionResults` trait and proper dependency injection

### 5. Views ✅
- ✅ Created list view with table component, search, filters, and actions
- ✅ Created create form view using Flux UI components
- ✅ Created edit form view with proper data loading
- ✅ Followed existing Blade component patterns

### 6. Routes & Navigation ✅
- ✅ Added RESTful routes following naming conventions
- ✅ Added sidebar navigation links
- ✅ Ensured proper route grouping and middleware

### 7. Localization ✅
- ✅ Added Spanish and English translations (most were already present)
- ✅ Added missing `search_vehicle_services_placeholder` translation
- ✅ Followed existing translation key patterns

## Key Patterns to Follow
1. **Action Pattern**: Database transactions, validation, ActionResult responses
2. **Service Pattern**: Base Service extension with CRUD operations
3. **Livewire Pattern**: WithPagination, HandlesActionResults traits
4. **View Pattern**: Flux UI components, reusable table/form components
5. **Error Handling**: Centralized through base classes
6. **Validation**: In Actions with proper error responses
